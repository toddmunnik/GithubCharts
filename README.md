# GithubCharts

Github Charts generates a continuous flow diagram from a Github repository's issues. The diagram displays 3 calculations - Backlog, In Progress and Completed - per week over the past 3 months. The diagram is calculated for one repository using labels and milestones to further filter and define the chart.

Any bugs, suggestions or comments can be directed to me, Todd Munnik at toddmunnik@gmail.com. Thanks for trying this app. All comments and bugs will help me make a better app.
