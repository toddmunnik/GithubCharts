# Charts for Github

Charts for Github generates a continuous flow diagram from a Github repository's issues. The diagram displays 3 calculations - Backlog, In Progress and Completed - per week over the past 3 months. The diagram is calculated for one repository using labels and milestones to further filter and define the chart.

Any bugs, suggestions or comments can be directed to me, Todd Munnik at toddmunnik@gmail.com or add an Issue to this repository. Thanks for trying this app. All comments and bugs will help this be a better app.

Features in design: 
- Charts for Github users - PR count, repos contributed to, Issue count
- Charts for Github repos - PR and Issue activity, tag history
